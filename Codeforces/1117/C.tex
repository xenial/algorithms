    We can find out the minimum number of days required by calculating a new starting position using the weather forecast. Then we binary search the minimum number of days required to get from the new starting position to the destination.
    
    We do this by making a prefix sum array of the wind directions. 
    Using the prefix sum array, we can calculate the values to offset the starting position by.
    We can calculate the offset for each axis with the following formula: \[p \cdot s_{max} + s_{d - 1 \pmod n}\]
    where $p$ is the period of the weather forecast, $s$ is the prefix sum and $d$ is the day. 
    
    We then binary search for the minimum amount of days needed to get from the new starting position to the destination.
